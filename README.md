Kindly download and build on your local.

I use the following stacks : JDK17 Maven 3.9.2 IntelliJ IdeaC

Dependencies :
Selenium 4.8.3
TestNG 7.7.1
Cucumber 7.12
Webdriver Manager 5.3.3 -> automatically downloads the needed webdriver
Log4J -> for logging of elements and actions, helps on debuging if the right element was selected or if it was successful on capturing the text. Helps on identifying what step did it stop or skips.

Note.
1. I found some issues while testing it first manually (kindly refer to the email I sent before). So what I did is filter the result for Person Justin and Food French toast, then validte the response.
2. This is my personal framework which I commonly used for something like this. Also, I know log4j has vulnerabilities, and it is been 2years since I last touch Java and haven't found a better logger for now.

Thank You
