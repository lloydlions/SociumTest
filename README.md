Kindly download and build on your local.

I use the following stacks : JDK17 Maven 3.9.2 IntelliJ IdeaC

Note.
1. I found some issues while testing it first manually (kindly refer to the email I sent before). So what I did is filter the result for Person Justin and Food French toast, then validte the response.
2. This is my personal framework which I commonly used for something like this. Also, I know log4j has vulnerabilities, and it is been 2years since I last touch Java and haven't found a better logger for now.

Thank You
